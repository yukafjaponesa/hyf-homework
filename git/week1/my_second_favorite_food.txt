Belgian Waffle

1)
Make the batter by stirring common pantry items together with other common refrigerator ingredients. I’m talking about flour, sugar, leavenings, butter, milk, and eggs. Things we all have.

2)
Once you whisk the batter together check the thickness or viscosity. If it’s too thick, add in a splash of milk. If it’s too thin, add in a sprinkle of flour. You want a pourable batter that will hold its shape for a second before falling back into the rest of the batter.

3)
Cook the waffles in a buttered hot waffle iron. Don’t use cooking spray, use melted butter and generously brush the iron. It makes a difference! Also, check the manufacturer’s recommended settings for cooking times.

4)
Serve with delicious toppings. Fruit, whipped cream, powdered sugar, maple syrup, butter, ya know, the good stuff.
